# ![](assets/1x/OC-tag.png) Original Cardactors
A collection of characters and modifications deposed upon Balatro by [Gwyn (hellgnoll)](https://shadenexus.com/) and [June (junipertheory)](https://butterflytheory.site/) at the behest of their [generous patrons](https://shadenexus.com/balatro/commissions.html). Jokers, textures, a hodge-podge of changes with maximal compatibility and all sorts of new little friends.
