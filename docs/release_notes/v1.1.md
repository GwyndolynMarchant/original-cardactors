# The Scandalous Sybil Throat vs. Balinological Technical Institute!

We have two major new additions to this version!

First off, with permission of the illustruous Iris Jay we have added the scandalous (and titular!) Sybil Throat, all the way from her smutty webcomic as a new **Rare** joker! Capture cards and turn others into them in mad-science-ray style!

Secondly, we introduce a multiversity of moofs (aka. "wolf cows") and their delightful head of operations! The Balinological Technical Institute brings some new options for players who like duplicate jokers, playing off Showman and some new vouchers!

As always you can see the full selection of what this mod adds on [its main site](https://shadenexus.com/balatro/).

## Installation:
1. Install [latest Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki/)

3. Create subfolder "OriginalCardactors" under "Mods" folder

## Update Notes:
